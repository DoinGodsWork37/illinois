## Meeting Info

* Date: Oct 28, 2015
* Time: 12:00 PM
* Location: [1040 NCSA][ncsa_map]

## Technical: "BASH basics: script your workflow"
[Aaron T. Anderson][aarona]

BASH is one of the most common command line programming environments in Linux/Unix. Some basic scripting commands will be covered to help automate common, repetitive tasks in the command line.

## Lightning Research Talks:

###"Vortex-induced Vibrations of a Sprung Cylinder with Nonlinear Internal Elements"
Antoine Blanchard

Structures immersed in a flow may experience vibrations due to their interaction with the surrounding fluid, which over time can cause fatigue or failure. We use direct numerical simulations to gain insight into the underlying dynamics of such interaction, and design novel devices that can mitigate undesired vibrations of the structure.

###"Towards uncertainty quantification of groundwater models with structural error"
Tianfang Xu (CSE Fellow)

Physically-based numerical models of groundwater flow are powerful quantitative tools to manage scarce groundwater resources. Inherent uncertainties associated with model structure and parameter lead to both random and systematic errors even in the output of a calibrated model. In this talk, I will present a complementary data-driven modeling framework to quantify the predictive uncertainty of groundwater models. The framework constructs error models based on machine learning techniques to correct for model structural error. The postprocessor and fully Bayesian implementations of the framework are illustrated using synthetic and real-world case studies.
