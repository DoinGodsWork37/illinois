As a computational scientist/engineer, utilizing Github's [pages][github] free webshosting allows you to get up and runnig quickly, it helps you become more comfortable with git, connects you to your contributions to open-source projects, and your stand apart from your other colleagues.

This tutorial will walk you through the steps of initializing the website (or cloning a template) and add your first content.
