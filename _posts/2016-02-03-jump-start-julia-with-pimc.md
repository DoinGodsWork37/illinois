title: Jump Start Julia with Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC)
author: Yubo ``Paul'' Yang

## Overview

Interpretive languages are easy to use but slow. Compiled languages are fast but hard to develop. [Julia][julia] seeks to deliver the best of both worlds as an interpretive language that is as fast as Fortran. Julia is also a modern language that is designed with cloud computing, distributed computing and data mining in mind. Participants will experience the ease and speed of Julia by implementing the path integral Monte Carlo algorithm to solve a quantum harmonic oscillator and compare speeds to a python equivalent. Jupyter notebooks for this tutorial are available at [julia notebook][julia-nb] and [python notebook][python-nb].

A short summary of PIMC can be found [here][pimc-summary].

## Meeting Info

* Date: Feb 3, 2016
* Time: 12:00 PM
* Location: [2000 NCSA][ncsa_map]

##Notes:

Julia installation scripts for [Fedora 23][fedora] and [Ubuntu 14.04][ubuntu]. Syntax highlighting in vim can be nicely integrated through [vundle][vundle].
